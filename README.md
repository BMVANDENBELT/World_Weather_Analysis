# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain weather data and the hotels attached to each city. From there we would create an itinerary for someone planning a trip from the four cities I had chosen below. After that, we developed a travel route from said cities (we connected to google maps API complete this task).
